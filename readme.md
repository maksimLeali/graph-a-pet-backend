# Pet finder (Back-end)
Pet finder backend is *wip* project that i'm developping in my free time.

## Installation 
Clone this repo to your device.
I suggest to create a virtual environment 

once you have cloned the repo, by enteryng the project folder install the requirments by using the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
and add the ```-r``` parameter so it will recursively add every needed module.

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```
if you don't have the python path variable setted use this instead

```bash
python3 -m pip intall -r requirments.txt
```

## Environment variable

Since i can't public everyprivate key but i want to let you know what variable are used in the project i made a ```config_fileds.yml``` file that will contain every variable name and path, but not the values

To make it work you will need to add a ```config.yml``` file on the root of the project ( same folder as )
